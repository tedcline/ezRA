      Assuming an   ezDefaults.txt   file in your current directory, similar to this,
            # Little Thompson Observatory in Berthoud, Colorado, starkids.org/visit/
            -ezRAObsName   LTO15             # 15-foot motored dish
            -ezRAObsLat    40.299512         # Observatory Latitude  (degrees)
            -ezRAObsLon    -105.084491       # Observatory Longitude (degrees)
            -ezRAObsAmsl   1524              # Observatory Above Mean Sea Level (meters)
      to define the Earth location of the antenna,
      the simplest (Windows) command examples might be like this,

            py  ..\ezRA\ezCol.py

            py  ..\ezRA\ezCon.py  data

            py  ..\ezRA\ezPlot.py  .

            py  ..\ezRA\ezSky.py  .

            py  ..\ezRA\ezGal.py  .

            py  ..\ezRA\ezGLon.py  .

            py  ..\ezRA\ezWhen.py  sun  Moon  R0P60  GP0P0  Gp80p10  R12.3P56.7

            py  ..\ezRA\ezDec.py  A180P45  -2401170523  moon  sun

      (Note that 4 of those command lines above end with a hard-to-see period !)
